                <h1>This is Me</h1>
                <p>From a young age, I was interested in the games and apps on my parents' phones.  This quickly grew into a fascination with how they worked, leading me to exploring the settings and tinkering its configurations.  That early curiosity sparked my passion for technology.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I'm a student studying Computer Engineering at De La Salle University. My studies have provided a strong foundation in engineering, programming, and networking. The programs that which i fun the most are deep learning, computer network security, and object-oriented programming.</p>
                <br>
                <p>To gain practical experience, I'm currently volunteering in an IT role at a manufacturing company.  This experience reinforced my academic learning, particularly in networking and troubleshooting, and it is builds my confidence by showing me real-world implementations.  It also develops my communication skills as I interact with those experiencing technical issues.  Overall, this volunteer work allows me to apply my knowledge, interact with the professionals, and learn about the IT industry.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I'm currently based in Carmona, Cavite.  Outside of technology, I enjoy movies, TV series, and computer games. I'm also keenly interested in exploring, tinkering, and even building an operating system using GNU/Linux. This curiosity, much like my early fascination with phones, fuels my desire to learn and explore the ever-evolving world of IT.</p>
